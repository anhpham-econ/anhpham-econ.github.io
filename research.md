["Natural Disasters and Mental Health: A Quantile Approach"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176519301387), with [Nadezhda Baryshnikova](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/nadezhda.baryshnikova), *Economics Letters*, 180, pp 62-66, 2019. 
- **Abstract**: This article investigates heterogeneity in the effect of experiencing natural disasters on mental health. Using Australian longitudinal data, we find that home owners generally show a reduction in mental health score after a disaster. There is a strong negative effect in the lowest two quantiles of the distribution for non-owners.

# International Trade and Development
"Shipping Cost and Development of the LLDCs: Panel Evidence from the Common Correlated Effects Approach", with [Nicholas Sim](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholassim/home), accepted, *World Economy*, 05/2019.
- **Abstract**: We estimate the impact of shipping cost on development for landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). Since container trade is important to them, we construct a country-specific measure of shipping cost, called *HarpexCost*, which combines the global cost of container shipping with information on how exposed to container shipping each LLDC is. We employ the Common Correlated Effects (CCE) estimator of Pesaran (2006) to first estimate the impact of *HarpexCost* on the LLDCs' development, and then recover the actual impact of shipping cost from these estimates. Overall, we observe that shipping cost has large negative effects on the LLDCs. Building upon these results, we provide new estimates on the cost of landlockedness and how trade benefits their development.

"Do Exports Affect Urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence From The Baltic Dry Index And Panel Regressions With Cross-Sectional Dependence", with [Nicholas Sim](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholassim/home)

"Child Mortality in the LDCs: The Role of Trade, Institutions and Environmental Quality", with [Faqin Lin](https://linfaqin.weebly.com/) and [Nicholas Sim](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholassim/home), School of Economics Working Papers 2015-15, University of Adelaide, School of Economics.
- **Abstract**: Child mortality is a persistent problem for the world's least developed countries (LDCs). Given that trade fosters economic development, one plausible solution is to raise the low levels oftrade in the LDCs, but how effective this approach might be could depend on the quality of institutions. In this paper, we use a novel instrumental variable approach to estimate the effect that trade might have on child mortality in the LDCs. We find that trade does not lead to lower levels of child mortality. In fact, in autocratic LDCs, trade could even cause child mortality to increase as we find that pollution, which adversely affects health, may rise with trade.

# Panel Data Applications
["Does Political and Economic Inequality affect Institutional Quality?"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-4932.12246), with [Nadezhda Baryshnikova](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/nadezhda.baryshnikova) and [Maria Wihardja](https://blogs.worldbank.org/team/maria-monica-wihardja), The *Economic Record*, 92(297), pp 190-208, 2016.
- **Abstract**: We study how inequality, democracy and economic development affect institutions in a dynamic panel model using data for 78 countries from 1984 to 2006. We suggest a model that assumes the sluggish adjustment of institutional quality and the interplay between the key explanatory variables. We find that democracy has a non‐linear effect on government stability and military involvement in politics. This effect depends on inequality and GDP per capita. Inequality matters for law and order and has a non‐linear effect as well. However, the results for wealth effect are mixed.


"Panel Data Quantile Regression with Two-Way Fixed Effects",  with [Nicholas Sim](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholassim/home), under review, 03/2019.
- **Abstract**: We construct a two-way fixed effect quantile regression estimator by applying the one-way fixed effect quantile regression technique of Canay (2011). We explore the Monte Carlo properties of this estimator under the assumption that the data generating process may contain a one- or two-way fixed effect. We apply this estimator to a panel data with country and year fixed effects to see if trade cost, as proxied by the Baltic Dry Index, affects the trade and income of least developed countries heterogeneously.

"Does the Rice for Poor subsidy reduce child marriage?", with [Nadezhda Baryshnikova](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/nadezhda.baryshnikova) and [Nicholas Sim](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholassim/home), 10/2018.
- **Abstract**: According to UNICEF, reducing child marriage is seen as one of the essentials to women’s empowerment and wellbeing, ending the intergenerational cycle of poverty and rights violation. In this paper, we study whether a food subsidy (Raskin) reduces child marriage occurrence using a panel life survey from Indonesia. Modelling treatment assignment with Coarsened Exact Matching and Diffs-in-Diffs, we show that the unconditional rice subsidy significantly reduces the likelihood of marrying as a child.

# Health Economics
"Population Diversity, Trust, and the Transmission of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa", with Pide Lun and [Nicholas Sim](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholassim/home)
- **Abstract**: We provide new evidence that population genetic diversity can mitigate the transmission of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we exploit the fact that trade may increase HIV incidence, and demonstrate that HIV transmits more easily in countries that are more genetically homogeneous.
