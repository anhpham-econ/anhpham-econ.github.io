Prior to joining the Healthy Cities Group, Anh was a [visiting lecturer](teaching.md) at the [School of Economics](https://economics.adelaide.edu.au/) within the same university.

Anh has been developing research interests in the areas of [housing](research.md#housing), [international trade and development](research.md#international-trade-and-development), [panel data applications](research.md#panel-data-applications) and [health economics](research.md#health-economics) after completing a [PhD in Economics](education.md#post-graduate-degrees) in 2016. 

Anh's current research activities are in understanding how social and economic public policy can be enhanced by evidence generated from the application of novel analytical strategies to diverse data. She has expertise in econometric modelling using nationally representative household-based longitudinal surveys (e.g. [HILDA](https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/hilda), [IFLS](https://www.rand.org/well-being/social-and-behavioral-policy/data/FLS/IFLS.html)) and large-scale administrative datasets (e.g. [PIA](https://www.dss.gov.au/review-of-australias-welfare-system/australian-priority-investment-approach-to-welfare))
